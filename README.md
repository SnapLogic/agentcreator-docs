# Running Locally

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or macOS** â€” Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Python 3**

### Getting Set Up

1. Fork this repository on Github. (SnapLogic employees can skip this step.)
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/agentcreator-docs.git`
3. `cd agentcreator-docs`
4. Create a virtual environment and install the requirements as required
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

```shell
# with python (and a virtual environment with mkdocs and all requirements installed) you can serve the contents from the root folder by running
mkdocs serve

# With docker, to build for deploying, run the following (from the root of this repository)
docker run --rm --name slate -v $(pwd)/build:/srv/slate/build -v $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate:latest build
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

### Deploying
If running via docker locally, follow these steps:
* `git commit -a -m "Commit message"`
* `git push`
* `docker run --rm --name slate -v $(pwd)/build:/srv/slate/build -v $(pwd)/source:/srv/slate/source slatedocs/slate:latest build`
* `./deploy.sh --push-only`
