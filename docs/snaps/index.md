# Snap Documentation

The Snaps provided in this Snap Pack are classified as Beta Snaps that are delivered with the intent to get new features in front of customers in their primary development organizations in an environment that is local to their existing assets.
Rather than in the SnapLogic SnapLabs environments where there is a need to migrate more assets external to the environment that they are actively using to see how the new features and enhancements could work in a pipeline that is closer to production.
